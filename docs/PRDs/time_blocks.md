## Feature: Time Block for Task Management Site

### Objective

To enhance task organization and time management through a "time block" feature that allows users to schedule tasks into customizable time slots within a weekly calendar view. This feature aims to improve productivity by providing visual task schedules and allowing easy, intuitive management of tasks and time.

### Key Features

1. **Weekly View**

   - A dynamic calendar interface displaying days of the week, segmented into customizable time slots.
   - Users can customize the start and end of their week for the calendar view.

2. **Time Block Creation and Customization**

   - Users can create, edit, and delete time blocks within the weekly view.
   - Time blocks are customizable with adjustable start times and durations:
     - Minimum duration: 10 minutes
     - Maximum duration: Full day

3. **Core Data Structure**

   - Introduce a "Block" as the core data structure with its own time information and linkage to the weekly view.
   - Users can create new tasks directly from the calendar view and assign tasks to these Blocks.

4. **Task Assignment**

   - Users can assign multiple existing tasks to a single time block with no restrictions on the number of tasks per block.

5. **Drag and Drop Support**

   - Intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for repositioning time blocks and assigning tasks within the calendar view.

6. **Overlap Handling**

   - Visual support for overlapping time blocks, allowing users to recognize and manage any conflicts or overlaps manually.
   - Include a button that automatically resolves overlapping time blocks by adjusting them in the calendar.

7. **Visual Indicators**

   - System to differentiate task priorities and statuses using distinct colors or icons within time blocks.

8. **Daily Summary & Analytics**

   - Provide a daily summary view with statistics showing the total assigned time and task counts, allowing users to review and optimize their daily schedules.
   - Suggested analytics options include:
     - Time Utilization: Percentage of scheduled time over total available time
     - Task Completion Rate: Number of tasks completed versus total tasks
     - Most Occupied Blocks: Identification of blocks with maximum tasks assigned
     - Task Priority Distribution: Breakdown of tasks based on priorities
     - Time Spent Analysis: Aggregate total time spent per task category weekly

### Design and Usability Considerations

- The interface should be user-friendly, with a clean and modern design adhering to UI/UX best practices.
- The design should ensure responsiveness and accessibility across devices and screen sizes.
- Maintain a cohesive look with the existing design elements of the site. Consider color schemes and typography used in the current UI.

### Dependencies and Limitations

- The feature should work independently within the platform and integrate seamlessly with existing task management functionalities.
- Initial implementation does not require integration with external calendar applications or multiple user roles.

### Performance Requirements

- Efficient rendering of calendar views and tasks, even with a large number of time blocks and tasks.
- Ensure that drag-and-drop actions are smooth and responsive across all supported browsers.
